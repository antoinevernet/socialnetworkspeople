## Learning goals

- Why should managers study networks. 
- Understand basic concepts: nodes, edges, ties, paths, components. 
- Appreciate the relevance of networks for management and projects.


::: notes
We’ll link concepts to decisions managers make: staffing, stakeholder engagement, innovation, risk, change.

And to why they are useful in the context of projects

Examples
- Visibility: being seen at work by influential others
- Execution: managing a team to deliver a project
- Innovation: brokers combining ideas
- Change & risk: identifying weak-points such as bridges and brokers early
- Inclusion: spotting systematic differences in network building or network structure between groups

The figure from @centola2018 shows how the presence of brokers in the network changes the network structure by creating clusters visible in the graph.

We will discuss what brokerage is and how it can be useful at length later in the class.

# Social Networks Beyond Organisations

## Epidemiology

- How diseases spread
- Identify super-spreaders and vulnerable nodes
- Design targeted interventions (vaccination, isolation)

::: notes
contagion and diffusion models are useful well beyond epidemiology (e.g., information spread, behavior adoption)

We will revisit these later in the class.

# Organizational Networks

::: notes
Going back to why managers should care
:::

## Visibility

. . . 

The org chart does not tell the whole story

. . .

Being seen by influential other is key for career progression




## Execution

. . .

Identify critical connectors, bottlenecks, and single points of failure in delivery chains.

managing a team to deliver a project


## Innovation

. . .

Spot bridges across teams that spark ideas; reduce insular silos.

- Innovation: brokers combining ideas



## Change & risk

. . .

Map trusted messengers for adoption; monitor key-person risk.

identifying weak-points such as bridges and brokers early

## Inclusion

. . .

Detect peripheral employees; design interventions for access & belonging.

spotting systematic differences in network building or network structure between groups


## What is SNA?

Social Network Analysis (SNA) studies relationships among actors (people/teams/orgs) to explain outcomes like performance, innovation, and resilience.

::: {.incremental}
- Visualize patterns (graphs)
- Measure structure (metrics)
- Intervene to improve outcomes (design)
:::

::: notes
visuals are not the end

metrics link structure to outcomes.
:::



## Basic terminology (1/3)

Nodes & edges 

- Nodes = actors (people, teams, orgs)
- Edges/ties = relationships (communication, advice, collaboration)
- Directed vs undirected (who nominates whom?)
- Weighted vs unweighted (strength/frequency)

##
::::: columns
::: column
Undirected (unweighted)
```{mermaid}
graph LR 
A((A))---B((B)) 
A---C((C)) 
B---C 
C---D((D))
```
:::

::: column
Directed (weighted)

```{mermaid}
graph LR 
A((A))-->|"3 msgs/wk"|B((B)) 
B-->|"1"|C((C))
C-->|"5"|A
```
:::
:::::

::: notes
Design matters: tie definition should align with the managerial question.
:::



## Basic terminology (2/3)

- Ego vs Whole networks
- Ego network: ties around a focal actor (“ego”)
- Whole network: ties among a bounded set (team, unit)

Open vs Closed networks
- Open: diverse, many external bridges
- Closed: dense, cohesive cluster

::: notes
Pros/cons: open = novelty; closed = trust & coordination.
:::



## Basic terminology (3/3)

Core properties
- Density: share of realized ties among all possible ties
- Diameter: longest shortest path in the network
- Centrality (who matters, how?)
- Degree (connections)
- Betweenness (bridging control)
- Closeness (reach/efficiency)
- Eigenvector/PageRank (connected to the well‑connected)

::: notes
Remind: choice of metrics driven by theory, not by availability.
:::



## Key theories for managers (1/3)

Strength of Weak Ties — Granovetter
- Weak ties often bridge groups and bring novel information
- Strong ties offer support but less novelty

Implications
- Hire & rotate to create non‑redundant contacts
- Encourage cross‑team communities/practices

::: notes
Use job search and innovation examples; caution: too many weak ties can dilute commitment.
:::



## Key theories for managers (2/3)

Structural Holes 
— Burt
- Gaps between groups with complementary info

Brokers spanning holes gain advantages:
- Access to non‑redundant information
- Control over information flows
- Creativity via recombination

Implications: Identify brokers; avoid over‑reliance on a single broker (burnout/risk).

::: notes
Broker ≠ always hero; design robust brokerage via multiple bridges.
:::



## Key theories for managers (3/3)

Small‑world phenomenon
- Short path lengths (“six degrees”) + local clustering
- Enables rapid reach without losing cohesion

Implications: Build shortcut ties across clusters (guilds, rotations, liaison roles).

::: notes
Small-worlds emerge naturally; maybe we can nudge structure with light‑touch design.
:::



## Steps from data to change

1. Visualize: map the network (survey, comms metadata, co‑authorship, tickets) 
2. Measure: align metrics to the managerial question 
3. Diagnose: bottlenecks, isolates, fragile bridges 
4. Intervene: teaming, mentoring, communities, role design 
5. Evaluate: track before/after; avoid unintended consequences

::: notes
Include ethics: consent, privacy, governance; use aggregated insights where possible.
:::




## Common pitfalls

- Over‑interpreting pretty pictures without metrics
- Assuming correlation = causation
- Ignoring boundary definitions (who’s in/out)
- Missing temporal dynamics (networks change!)
- Neglecting ethics & privacy



# Thank you



## Appendix: handy definitions

- Path: sequence of unique nodes connected by edges
- Geodesic: shortest path between two nodes
- Component: maximally connected subgraph
- Assortativity: similarity of connected nodes on a trait
- Homophily: tendency to connect to similar others



## Appendix: sample survey items

- Advice network: “In the last month, who did you go to for help with [topic]?”
- Trust network: “Whose judgement do you trust on [topic]?”
- Collaboration network: “Which teams did you collaborate with on [project] in Q3?”
